            <p class="para2">Farming is the first and prime occupation of human beings yet has never become obsolete. Prevalence of water scarcity and non-availability of scientific techniques has made this occupation 
                one of the most neglected in India. With the advent in Industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) and Information Communication Technology, the agriculture sector has witnessed a major come-back. 
                The need for usage of modern technologies like Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Block Chain, Machine Learning, Robotics and Automation for converting the Conventional Agriculture 
                to Digital Agriculture is being explored and implemented. The mission envisages development of IoT & AI based Smart Farming Systems for monitoring the climatic adaptations, soil health, plant 
                health, pest and disease infestations using sensors and finally create a holistic knowledge ecosystem through training, Research & Development and outreach & consultancy.</p></div>
